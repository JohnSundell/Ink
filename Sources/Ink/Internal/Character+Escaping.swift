// For future reference to anyone thinking of escaping text allowed in unquoted attributes. (Very scary and messy)
// Except for alphanumeric characters, escape all characters with ASCII values less than 256 with the &#xHH;
// format (or a named entity if available) to prevent switching out of the attribute.
// The reason this rule is so broad is that developers frequently leave attributes unquoted.
// Properly quoted attributes can only be escaped with the corresponding quote.
// Unquoted attributes can be broken out of with many characters, including [space] % * + , - / ; < = > ^ and |.
